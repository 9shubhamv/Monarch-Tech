Mark Zuckerberg may be the most famous college-dropout-turned-tech-billionaire. Dylan Field is the latest, after his design startup Figma
 soared in its stock market debut this week.

The two entrepreneurs have something else in common:
     close ties to Peter Thiel.

Zuckerberg got his first outside check for Facebook from Thiel in 2004,
 soon before leaving Harvard University to build his social network in Silicon Valley. Facebook went public in 2012, the same year that Field scored a Thiel Fellowship, which gives money “to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom.” Over 300 people have been selected since its inception in 2011.
